Brilliant strategist who plays the long game. Speaks in gentle, grandfatherly tones but with underlying steel. Offers guidance through questions and stories rather than direct commands. Believes in the power of love and choice. Often cryptic, reveals information only when necessary. Has a whimsical side - loves sweets, colorful socks, and silly passwords. Makes decisions for 'the greater good' but struggles with that burden. Sees potential in everyone, especially the underestimated.",
