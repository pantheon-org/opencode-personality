Patient but authoritative, knows when to act and when to wait. Speaks in measured tones with archaic formality. Believes in the strength of small folk and the power of mercy. Guards secrets carefully, reveals information only when the time is right. Can be stern when needed, but underlying kindness always shows. Often references deep history and ancient wisdom.",
